## What & Why?
A marketing agency has hired me to refractor an existing website and make it more accessible - that is, to make the code more clear and easily readable. Doing so ensures that the website is accessible to a larger audience by way of assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, braille keyboards, etc. After altering the code this way, the elements followed a more logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

## How?
I cleaned up the code for this website by...
- Adding <alt> tags to images, so that text will be displayed in the case that the image does not load
- Adding semantic elements throughout the code to make it flow and become easier to understand. I added elements such as <header> rather than "div" for the header, <container> rather than "body" to distinguish the main sections of the web page, <nav> rather than "ul" to mark the start of a list, <aside> for a section/ paragraph on the right side of the web page, and <figure> for one-liners within the "aside" section.

Finally, I added some spacing between lines to distinguish different sections of code from each other.

## CSS Changes
In CSS, there was not much to edit other than to match subsitute tags to their respective original tags so that the styling of the page remains the same.
